Hi, I'm **Anway Ghatak**, currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering from AOT. I completed my Class 10 from St. Aloysius and Class 12 from HVMS. Alongside my engineering studies, I'm also learning programming languages like C, C#, and HTML, and I have a deep love for physics.

I'm particularly interested in the automobile and aerospace industries, and I hope to contribute to these fields in the future. In my free time, I love playing basketball to clear my mind, playing the guitar, traveling, and exploring new foods and flavors.

My current goal is to complete my B.Tech, pursue an M.Tech abroad, and eventually earn a PhD. Ultimately, I want to live a life where I can travel the world and continue exploring both professionally and personally.
