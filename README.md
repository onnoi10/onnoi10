# Hi, I'm Anway Ghatak! 👋

I'm an enthusiastic **Mechanical Engineering** student at AOT, deeply passionate about **how machines work** and the physical world around us. My core interests lie in **automobiles** and **aerospace**, and I’m excited to make my mark in these industries.

Along with my engineering studies, I’m also exploring **coding** — currently learning **C**, **C#**, and **HTML** as a starting point, with plans to dive into more languages in the future. But my true enthusiasm lies in understanding **physical machines** and how things operate, which fuels my curiosity and drive.

### A bit about my journey:
- 🎓 Completed Class 10 at **St. Aloysius** and Class 12 at **HVMS**.
- 🏀 **Basketball player**, using the game to refresh my mind.
- 🎸 **Acoustic guitar enthusiast**, always finding time to strum a few chords.
  
### My ambitions:
- 💡 **B.Tech:** On track to complete my Mechanical Engineering degree.
- 🌍 **M.Tech:** Planning to pursue further studies abroad.
- 🎓 **PhD:** Aiming to dive deeper into research and innovation.

I’m always excited to connect with others who share a passion for engineering, coding, or simply a love for learning new things. Let’s collaborate and explore the world of possibilities together!
